1.Author Information:    Name: YI ZHENG    ID: 2728036429   Email: zhen578@usc.edu2.Compiler and platform:
   use c++ to implement the algorithms    AppCode on OS X3.How to run?
   (1)For cpp file:   Compile: In command line, type g++ -o program_name xxx.cpp   Run: In command line, type ./program_name input.raw output.raw
   (2)For m file:
   Open MATLAB to run the file directly    4.Instructions:   There are three folders for the three problems in HW3.P1:    swirl effect:  swirl_effect.cpp			    3D camera capture:  forward_mapping.cpp                        backward_mapping.mP2:    dithering : dithering.cpp    error diffusion using three matrices: error_diffusion.cpp    scalar color halftone (error diffusion for each CMY channel): scalar_color_halftone.cpp
    vector color halftone: vector_color_halftone.cppP3:    shrinking the objects to count nails or holes: shrinking_nails_holes.cpp
    shrinking the objects after hole-filling to count objects:shrinking_object_count.cpp
    thinning and skeletonizing of the horse: thinning_skeletonizing.cpp
