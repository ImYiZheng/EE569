IMPLEMENTATION  
  A morph is a simultaneous warp of the image shape and a cross-dissolve of the image colors. The warp is controlled by the transformation between correspondence. In this project, two method are used for image morphing. One is the triangulation method with a defined triangular mesh over the control points. For each meshed triangle, it is easy to find the affine transformation of three points.
